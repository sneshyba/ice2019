Nesh observes: Based on the increase in the girth over images A-D, and using the time stamps that show the four images were taken over the course of about a minute, this crystal appears to be growing at a rate of about 20 um/minute, or 0.3 um/second.For the segments.nml coverage (basal), it seems that the roughness sigma_w = 0.092, with eta_w very close to 1, when analyzed over two decades of probability. The horizontal wavelength is on the order of 2-3 um (visual inspection).For the segments2.nml coverage (Gray’s arc), the sigma_w and eta_w are almost identical, but the physical scale is much bigger: the horizontal wavelength is on the order of 10 um. Going back and looking at segments2, the information content scores are in the range 10-20, except for segments 0 and 2, which are lower.
